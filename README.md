# Metro Vancouver Restaurant Finder (MVRF)

**Project Abstract**

The MVRF (Metro Vancouver Restaurant Finder) is a web application that will help a restaurant-goer find new places to eat, with a focus on accounting for different dietary restrictions and allergies. Users can create an account to store their dietary preferences, and are able to view detailed information about restaurants, and filter them by their indicated preferences. Users will also be able to contribute their own knowledge by adding restaurants, and also can add reviews to existing restaurant entries. Admins have elevated privileges to be able to remove entries from users, or remove users from the platform. Overall, this web application will help to provide important information about restaurants to those with dietary restrictions.

Our web app is made using Ruby on Rails.

* Ruby version: 3.2.2

* Rails version: 7.1.1

* Server and client in use: PostgreSQL
