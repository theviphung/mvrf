# Metro Vancouver Restaurant Finder (MVRF)

**Project Abstract**
    The MVRF (Metro Vancouver Restaurant Finder) is a web application that will help any restaurant-goer easily find new places to eat, with a focus on accounting for different dietary restrictions and preferences. Users will be able to filter and sort restaurants by typical parameters, such as proximity, price, and user reviews, but most importantly if a restaurant offers options that meet a userâ€™s specific dietary restrictions. By conveniently displaying admin-curated information, users can feel confident they will find a restaurant that has dishes they can enjoy that accommodate their dietary needs. Users will also be able to contribute their own insights into good options that are available in the Metro Vancouver area by submitting ratings and reviews. Overall, this web application will help to provide important information to others with dietary restrictions.


Some information about our web app's configuration:

* Ruby version: 3.2.2
